# Introduction to C 
This project uses the simple project of turning LEDs on and off to teach students some basic ANSI C code including type casting, register read and write, structs, bit manipulation, and I/O. The objective is to blink the LEDs at a rate of 2Hz. On the MSP432 launchpad, the red, green, and blue LEDs were switched on and off simultaneously.
