# ECE3430 Instructional Material
Written for the development of the ECE 3430 course at University of Virginia

## Boards Used and Development
Many of the projects here were written for the MSP430G2553, the board used currently (Spring 2018) in the introduction to Embedded Systems class. Professor Todd A. DeLong asked me and another student to migrate some of these projects to the MSP432P401R. The projects still using the MSP430 were not migrated because they make use of proprietary "shield" boards designed for the MSP430 by Professor Harry C. Powell at the University of Virginia.
