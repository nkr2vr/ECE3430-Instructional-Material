# Digital Signals Processing

This lab intoduces students to concepts of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC), Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC), sampling, and filtering. Students completing this project will use the ADC to sample the input at a rate of 480Hz, use a circular buffer to record samples, perform a filtering operation on the data, and use the DAC to output the filtered data.
To verify their solution's performance, the students characterize the frequency response magnitude by recording data points and plotting them alongside the theoretical response. A MATLAB script is provided for them to do so (see FrequencyResponse.m in the MATLAB scripts repository).
